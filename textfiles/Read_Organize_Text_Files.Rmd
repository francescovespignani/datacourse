## Reading data in R 

This is a very infromal tutorial for non-programmer

Usually R stores the *current state of affairs*
in a file called .RData when you logout so
you'll find the variables of the previous session.

When you write some piece of code you may
forget something, like defining some variables that
you have done in the terminal. To check evrything
from sratch it is useful to delete all stuff that is
currently in memory,  this can be done with the following command:

```{r code_rm}
rm(list=ls())
```

The files we want to read are in the folder named astudy and consist of lines delimited by newline characters ([escape sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_sequences_in_C) is \n) delimited by a special charather the tab (escape sequence is '\t')
